# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component provisions an encrypted S3 bucket configured to receive VPC Flow Logs.
usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component.

  **IMPORTANT**: This component expects the `aws_flow_log` resource to be created externally. Typically that is
  accomplished through [the `vpc` component](../vpc/).

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      vpc-flow-logs-bucket:
        vars:
          name: "vpc-flow-logs"
          noncurrent_version_expiration_days: 180
          noncurrent_version_transition_days: 30
          standard_transition_days: 60
          glacier_transition_days: 180
          expiration_days: 365
  ```
